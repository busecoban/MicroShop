# üõçÔ∏è MicroShop ‚Äì Microservice E-Commerce System

MicroShop is a personal software engineering project designed to implement a realistic, microservice-based e-commerce backend system. The project follows modern software architecture principles such as service autonomy, asynchronous communication, containerized deployment, and observability.

This project is developed for self-improvement, inspired by the CSE438 Microservice Architecture syllabus, but is not affiliated with any course or institution.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Build a scalable and modular e-commerce backend system
- Learn and apply microservice patterns and distributed system principles
- Practice with REST APIs, messaging queues, containerization, and observability tools
- Gain experience with multiple languages and frameworks

## üß± System Architecture

| Service         | Tech Stack            | Database        | Description                                       |
| --------------- | --------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| User Service    | .NET 8 (ASP.NET Core) | PostgreSQL      | Handles user registration and login with JWT auth |
| Product Service | Node.js + Express     | MongoDB + Redis | Manages product catalog and caching               |
| Order Service   | Spring Boot (Java 21) | PostgreSQL      | Processes orders asynchronously using RabbitMQ    |

- Each service runs independently in its own container
- Services communicate via REST APIs and RabbitMQ messages
- Databases are not shared across services

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- C# (.NET 8), Java (Spring Boot), JavaScript (Node.js)
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis
- RabbitMQ for asynchronous messaging
- Docker & Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration
- Prometheus, ELK Stack for observability
- Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
- Git & GitHub for version control
